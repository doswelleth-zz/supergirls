### 🔐 Design

Superkids were designed as [ERC-721](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/) tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, and JSON metadata on [IPFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System).

Superkids are created with specific attributes inspired by science fiction, and are provably rare, and have designated [rarity weights](https://morganlinton.medium.com/a-not-so-quick-primer-on-analyzing-nft-trait-rarity-3b8189086800) associated with their uniqueness.
